    - Create framework for handling of specific operations (e.g. changeTextPageElementsContents)
- Handle toggleSize specifics inside dataServices.js, instead of controllers.js
- Clear deletedElementIds on allPageElementsDeletedEventHandler() in persistenceService
- Persist deletedElementIds in local storage
- Use _.defaults() to simplify PageElement instantiation

DONE
---------
- select element by clicking on it
- insert element at position: underlying giant background element to capture clicks
    -> text

        => font-style
        => font-weight
        => text-decoration
- Handle socketio error events
- Normalized pageElementId matching
- Periodically send persistence/deletion of elements out of sync with server (as part of client-side reconciliation on server connect/reconnect)
- Server: propagate deletion of unknown element, as it could have been deleted while server was offline
- Call callback on socketio connect/reconnect, so that relist elements from server (as part of client-side reconciliation on server connect/reconnect)
- Fix PageElement prototype inheritance
- Maintain list of deletedElementIds, on both client and server sides
- Use specific D3 CSS selector to only refresh what's needed
- Use events instead of deep collection watch
- Fix D3 functions by type to remove grouping by type in scope
