- child controller for text edition dialog
- double-click for child edition
- More element types
    -> image
    -> non-SVG mode (HTML)
- Keyboard shortcuts

DONE
---------
- select element by clicking on it
- insert element at position: underlying giant background element to capture clicks
    -> text
    -> circle
    -> rectangle
- delete button
- Local storage
- change attributes by button
    -> all
        => color
        => size / font-size / width & height

        => font-style
        => font-weight
        => text-decoration
- Handle socketio error events
- Normalized pageElementId matching
- Periodically send persistence/deletion of elements out of sync with server (as part of client-side reconciliation on server connect/reconnect)
- Server: propagate deletion of unknown element, as it could have been deleted while server was offline
- Call callback on socketio connect/reconnect, so that relist elements from server (as part of client-side reconciliation on server connect/reconnect)
- Fix PageElement prototype inheritance
- Maintain list of deletedElementIds, on both client and server sides

BUGS
----------
- Use deep collection watch instead of events
- Fix D3 functions by type to remove grouping by type in scope
- Use specific D3 CSS selector to only refresh what's needed
